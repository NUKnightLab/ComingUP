# ComingUP
Collaborative Innovation Class Project

INITIAL SETUP
*****************************************************************************************************
To run the app you must have cordova installed on the computer. To install cordova download nodejs at https://nodejs.org/. 
Open up the terminal and type npm install cordova -g, then install ionic in the same fashion.
 After you have all of that installed download the code base from the google drive.
Get in the directory nodeComingup and type npm install mongoose --save.
Change the IP in the EventDate Service in \ComingUP\www\js\Services to your IP otherwise the node server wonâ€™t allow the API calls.
Get in the ComingUP directory and in the terminal type ionic serve and in a separate terminal get in the nodeComingUp directory and type npm start. 



If you have any trouble just let me know!
